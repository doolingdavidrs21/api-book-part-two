    "Some of the most interesting work in custom metrics is happening in football, where the NFL has sponsored an annual analytics contest called the [Big Data Bowl](https://oreil.ly/5h1RE), where data students and professionals research and propose new metrics for prizes, job prospects, and the excitement of seeing their work included in TV broadcasts. It has a special track devoted to creating new custom metrics, such as converted tackle opportunity and path analysis via swarm-tackle accuracy (PASTA). Some have made their way into the broadcast booth, and more are on the way."
